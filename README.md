# SymmetricDS
SymmetricDS is a database and file synchronization solution that is platform-independent, web-enabled, and database agnostic.  SymmetricDS was built to make data replication across two to tens of thousands of databases and file systems fast, easy and resilient.  We specialize in near real time, bi-directional data replication across large node networks over the WAN or LAN.

##Development
We use Eclipse for development.

To setup a development environment run the following commands:
```
cd symmetric-assemble
./gradlew develop
```

This will generate Eclipse project artifacts.  You can then import the projects into your Eclipse workspace.
